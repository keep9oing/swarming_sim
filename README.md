# Flocks, Mobs, and Figure Eights: Swarming as a Distributed Lemniscatic ArchInspired by the natural mobbing behavior of birdflocks, this work presents a novel, distributed swarming strategycalled the Dynamic Lemniscatic Arch. It resolves the problemof producing globally-stable, evenly-spaced lemniscate (or,figure-eight) trajectories while relying on local interactions only.Previous work in lemniscate curves has typically relied onpredetermined trajectories, rather than on an the emergentstructure of the swarm. Furthermore, we enrich the traditional2-dimensional lemniscate plane curve structure by forming anarch in the third dimension. This arch provides more consistentcoverage in surveillance type tasks and, with minor variationsin parameters, can be used to produce mobbing behavior. Thetechnique relies on time-varying quaternion rotations linked tothe positions of dynamic virtual agents. These virtual agents areinduced by the actual positions of agents in the swarm. Weprovide a mathematical proof of stability, which translates toevenly-spaced swarms that are scaled by radial distance andangular speed parameters. Simulations show that the strategyperforms well with multiple agents and in numerous differentconfigurations.## CitingThe code is opensource but, if you reference this work in your own reserach, please cite me.
