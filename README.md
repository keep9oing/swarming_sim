# My swarming simulator## ReynoldsThis project implements Reynolds Rules of Flocking (or *Boids*), which is based on a balance between three steering forces:- **Cohesion**: the tendency to steer towards the center of mass of neighbouring agents- **Alignment**: the tendency to steer in the same direction as neighbouring agents- **Separation**: the tendency to steer away from neighbouring agents Reynolds (1987) did not provide equations for the steering forces above, so we have taken some artistic liberty and had a bit of fun. In the results section, you will see variations on how "neighbours" are defined. We demonstrate free flocking and flocking to escort (i.e. following a reference). A more formal definition and analysis of flocking was provided by Olfati-Saber (2006), which we have implemented [here](https://github.com/tjards/flocking_network)Craig Reynolds, ["Flocks, Herds, and Schools:A Distributed Behavioral Model"](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1987/boids.html), *Computer Graphics, 21(4) (SIGGRAPH '87 Conference Proceedings)*, pages 25-34, 1987.## SaberThis project implements flocking for a large network of aerial vehicles. The strategy is based on the (elegant) 3-part distributed formulation proposed in:Reza Olfati-Saber, ["Flocking for Multi-Agent Dynamic Systems: Algorithms and Theory"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1605401), *IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control*, Vol. 51 (3), 2006.The formulation involves three distinct terms:1. **Alpha-Alpha Interaction (alignment)** - encourages the agents to align in a lattice formation. The function represents other vehicles as "alpha" agents. 2. **Alpha-Beta Interaction (obstacle avoidance)** - discourages the agents from colliding with obstacles. The function represents obstacles as "beta" agents.3. **Gamma Feedback (navigation)** - encourages motion towards a static or dynamic target. The function represents the target as a "gamma" agent.When combined together, these terms produce an emergent behaviour that is refered to as "flocking". ## Starling FlockingH.
